			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>Hello, my name is Lachlan Cooke and I am a 2023 graduate of Western Sydney University, having completed my Bachelor's of Computer Science, majoring in Cyber Security.</p>
			<p>Through my time at university, I had a roughly 6 month time period where I was able to gain work experience as an IT Field Technician, helping customers with various IT related issues such as setting up and troubleshooting printers, networks, computers, and Internet Of Things devices.<br>
			This work allowed me to further realise my passion for helping others with computer related issues, from which I already had experience as the family-and-friends go-to "IT guy".</p>

			<p>I have consistently worked to cultivate a diverse range of skills across the IT landscape. I have released python scripts, deployed game and file servers, built computers, and completed many other small projects to see where my interests in IT lie.</p>
			<p>With a desire to solve problems, I thrive in challenging environments and would love the opportunity to demonstrate my abilities.</p>
			<p>I am experienced with all major operating systems, where I use a combination of Windows and Ubuntu Linux on my personal computer, as well as use of MacOS, where I was required to virtualise it both for a personal project and for a university course.</p>
			<p>I am proficient in a wide variety of software, including but not limited to; Word, Excel, Sketchup, Blender, and Photoshop. I am most confident in programming via Python, however I also have experience with C++, C, and Java.</p>
			<p>The website you are viewing this text on has been made without external tools, by me, please excuse any formatting issues, or even better, tell me about them so I may fix them.
			<br>Although I am capable of basic website development and enjoy doing so, in all honesty it is not what I am passionate about when compared to helping people troubleshoot computer-related issues.</p>
			<p>Thank you for taking the time to read my portfolio, feel free to contact me through any of the methods listed <a href="contact.html">here</a>.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Regards,</p>
			<p>Lachlan</p>
